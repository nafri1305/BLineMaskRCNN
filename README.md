# Fine-tune Mask-RCNN on a customized BLine dataset
This program is created for my Final Year Project(FYP) in Nanyang Polytechnic.

To get started, download fypProgram v2.1.ipynb and run it on Google Colab. There are steps in the program to guide you in using it.

I used VGG Image Annotator ([VIA](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/)) to annotate the training and validation images.

The original code is from [haochen23's fine-tune-MaskRcnn repo](https://github.com/haochen23/fine-tune-MaskRcnn), whic is adopted from [mattport's Mask-RCNN repo](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN).
