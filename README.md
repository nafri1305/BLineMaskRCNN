# Mask-RCNN on a customized B-line dataset
This program is created for my Final Year Project(FYP) in Nanyang Polytechnic.

To get started, open [fypProgramFinal.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/nafri1305/BLineMaskRCNN/blob/main/fypProgramFinal.ipynb) and run it on Google Colab. There are steps in the program to guide you in using it.

I used VGG Image Annotator ([VIA](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/)) to annotate the training and validation images.

The original code is from [haochen23's fine-tune-MaskRcnn repo](https://github.com/haochen23/fine-tune-MaskRcnn), whic is adopted from [mattport's Mask-RCNN repo](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN).
