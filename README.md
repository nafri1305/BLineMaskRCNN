# Fine-tune Mask-RCNN on a customized BLine dataset

There is a total number of 100 BLine images in the dataset. 75 images are used for training and 25 images are used for validation.

I used VGG Image Annotator ([VIA](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/)) to annotate the training and validation images.

The original code is from haochen23's fine-tune-MaskRcnn repo, whic is adopted from mattport's Mask-RCNN repo.
